Effective Heart Disease Prediction Using IBM Auto AI Service
Following are the steps involved:
1. Created IBM Watson Studio
2. Created Machine Learning App
3. Using Auto AI in Machine Learning, patientdataV6.csv is uploaded for applying classifiers.
4. Snap Random Forest Classifier is found to be the best classifier for predictions.
5. We test the set before deploying the app.
6. Created Node-Red App to launch app.
7. The node red app for "Effective Heart Disease Prediction Using IBM Auto AI Service" is created and launched.

The URL for this app is https://node-red-iscsw-2022-07-27.mybluemix.net/ui/#!/0?socketid=rjsWuM0QL7fNlhffAAAB

Result is shown in the screenshot: "Screenshot of prediction in App.png"
